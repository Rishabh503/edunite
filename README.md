## 🚀 Overview

*EduAssist* is a unified AI-powered web application that enhances classroom learning through intelligent support for both students and teachers. It brings together real-time classroom insights, doubt-solving tools, 3D learning models, and workflow tracking into one interactive platform.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Modern classrooms struggle to provide interactive, personalized, and tech-enabled support. Students hesitate to ask doubts, while teachers lack tools to assess real-time understanding. Existing tools are fragmented, and there's no single platform that brings it all together — EduAssist fills this gap.
